Python Important Notes
 use control + / for commenting a paragraph
use dir() function to get the details of a module
use help() to get the details of a function
*args can be used to make a function when inputs not defined
**kwargs will be used when the input contains a key value pair like a dict
 print(functionname.__doc__) to access documentation of a function
=================================
Common Functions => Applicable on all Datatypes such as strings, list, tuples, sets and Dict.
# len
# max
# min 
# sorted 
# Sum
=================================
String functions = > Applicable only on strings
# Captitalize
# Title
# Lower
# upper
# Swapcase
Similar functions in string
# Count
# Find
# Index
Important Function in string
# Split
# join
#Replace
#Strip
=================================
List  functions = > Applicable only on List
# Count
# Index
# Append -> Add one item at a time
# Extend -> Add Mutilple items at one
# Insert -> Add items according to index no.
 Deleting functions = > Applicable only on List
# del -> deletes the entire list or a single item 
# remove -> removes item as per specification
# pop -> removes item as per index
# clear -> empties the list
Operations in List => only 3 Operations
# Arithemetic ( + and * )
# Membership ( in and not in)
# Loop
=================================
Tuple  functions => Applicable only on Tuple
# Count
# Index
Operations in Tuple => only 3 Operations
# Arithemetic ( + and * )
# Membership ( in and not in)
# Loop
=================================
Set  functions => Applicable only on set
# add -> adds a single item to a set
# update -> adds multiple item to a set using list
# union function ->prints only unique and no duplicates 
# isdisjoint -> checks if anything is common between sets
# issubset -> checks if one set is a part of another set
#issuperset -> checks if small set is a part of big set
Deleting functions => deletes from a set
# del -> deletes the entire set
# discard -> deletes a single item from a set
# remove -> throws an error when item not in list
# pop -> randomly deletes item from a set
# clear -> empties the set
Operations in set  => Applicable only on set
# union(" | ")->prints only unique and no duplicates 
# Intersection("&")-> prints only common items
# Difference("-")->prints the difference between set
# Symmetric Difference("^")-> print everything except common
# Membership ( in and not in)
# Loop
Frozen Set => Frozen set is immutable
# only read functions will work on frozen sets
===================================
Dict  functions => Applicable only on set
# items 
# keys
# values
# update
Deleting functions => deletes from a Dict
# pop -> deletes item from a Dict by key reference
# popitem -> deletes last key value from the dict
# clear -> empties the Dict
# del -> deletes the entire Dict
Operations in Dictionary   => Applicable only on Dict
# Membership ( in and not in) -> only works on keys
# Loop
